General information about the Thunderboard Sense
================================================

Local filesystem
----------------

There is a 1 MB external flash on the Thunderboard sense.
This is accessible under the directory ``/flash``.
The filesystem is used to store store two standard files, ``boot.py`` and 
``main.py``, it is also used to store the users own program. 

Boot modes
----------

During normal power up, the Thunderboard Sense boots into standard mode:
``boot.py`` will be executed first, then ``main.py`` will run. 

You can override the boot sequence by holding down the both buttons 
on the front of the Thunderboard Sense before starting or resetting the board.
As you continue to hold down both buttons, the two small LEDs on the front
of the board will turn on and off sequentially. When you let go of the
buttons, the selected mode will run.

The modes are:

1. Green LED only, *standard boot*: run ``boot.py`` and ``main.py``.
2. Red LED only, *safe boot*, don't run any script on boot-up.
3. Green and Red LEDs together, *filesystem reset*: resets the flash filesystem
   to the factory state.

If the filesystem becomes corrupt, booting into mode 3 will fix it.
