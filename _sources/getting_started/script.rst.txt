How to run transferred scripts
------------------------------

At boot two scripts will be run (if not booting in safe mode).
First the file ``boot.py`` will be executed. ``boot.py`` can be used to
perform initial setup. After ``boot.py`` has completed, the file
``main.py`` will be executed. Other files can also be executed by using
the ``execfile`` function::

    execfile('my_file.py')

After ``main.py`` has finished executing, a REPL prompt will be
presented on the serial port.
