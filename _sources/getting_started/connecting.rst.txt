Getting a MicroPython REPL prompt
=================================

In order to communicate with the device you need to have installed
the `CP210x driver`_.

Windows
-------

On Windows you also need to install a serial console, e.g. PuTTY_.
After installation open Device Manager, then find the JLink CDC UART Port device
under the Ports subsection. Note down the COM port number (e.g. COM4).
THen open your serial console and connect to the COM port.

macOS
-----

Open a terminal and issue the following command::

    ls /dev/tty.usbmodem*

Then note down the correct name and substistute ``com-port-name`` in
the following command with it::

    screen /dev/'com-port-name'

When you are finished you can exit by typing CTRL+A CTRL+\\.


Linux
-----

Open a terminal and issue the following command::

    ls /dev/ttyACM*

Then note down the correct name and substitute ``com-port-name`` in
the following command with it::

    screen /dev/'com-port-name'

When you are finished you can exit by typing CTRL+A CTRL+\\.

Using the REPL prompt
---------------------

When you first connect to the Thunderboard Sense, you might see a blank screen,
press enter and you whould be presented with a MicroPython prompt, ``>>>``.
If not, try to to reset the board (see instructions below). 

You can now type in simple commands (you do not have to type the 
``>>>`` yourself) such as::

    >>> print("Hello world!")
    Hello world
    >>> tbsense.RGBLED.on()
    >>> tbsense.RGBLED.off()
    >>> 1 + 2
    3


Resetting the board
-------------------

If something goes wrong with the board, you can reset it. Pressing CTRL+D when 
the prompt is open performs a soft reset, while pressing the reset button 
on the front side of the Thunderboard Sense.
