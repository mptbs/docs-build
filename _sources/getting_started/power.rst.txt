Power control
=============

When running on battery, your script ought to conserve power. One way of doing this is to put the controller to 
sleep for a certain amount of time. This can be done with the ``tbsense.deepsleep(s)`` function, where ``s`` 
is the number of seconds it will sleep for. Following are two code examples for reading the value of the 
temperature sensor. 

The first example reads the sensor data continuously::

    import tbsense

    while True:
    
	tbsense.Environment.start()
	temp = tbsense.Environment.temperature()
	tbsense.Environment.stop()
	print( temp )

The second example uses the ``tbsense.deepsleep()`` function to control how often the sensor is read. 
The micro controller goes to sleep between the sensor readings to conserve power::

    import tbsense

    while True:
    
	tbsense.Environment.start()
	temp = tbsense.Environment.temperature()
	tbsense.Environment.stop()
	print( temp )
	tbsense.deepsleep(60)

The longer the chip is sleeping between the sensor readings, the less power is used.
Below is a comparison of how much energy is used with and without the ``deepsleep()`` function.

As seen above, the average current consumption while reading the temperature is 7.8 mA. By using the 
``deepsleep()`` function and only performing readings every minute, the average current consumption is reduced 
to approximately 8 :math:`\mu A`. Running this application on a coin cell battery with 250 mAh capacity, would result in a 
battery life of 31 250 h, which is approximately 3.5 years. 

Therefor it is a good idea to use the ``deepsleep()`` fuction when making a battery powered application,
in order to increase battery life. It is also good practice to turn off sensors and LEDs not needed when running on battery.
The RGBLEDs should not be used when running on battery, as they consume a lot of power (119.6 mA for all 4 RGBLEDs).
