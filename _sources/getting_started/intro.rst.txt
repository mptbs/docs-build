The Thunderboard Sense is a low cost IoT development board from Silicon labs.
The board comes with a builtin radio that can support Bluetooth LE, Thread, 
Zigbee and proprietary protocols. The board also comes with powerful RGB LEDs
and several sensors:

- Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
- Hall effect sensor
- Pressure sensor
- Relative humidity and temperature sensor
- Microphone
- UV and Ambient light sensor
- Indoor Air Quality sensor


Layout of the board
-------------------

For power, the board can be powered either via the micro USB port, 
a CR2032 coincell battery or another external power source.

There are four RGB LEDs on the board, two on the front and two on the back.
This is accompanied by two smaller LEDs on the front side of the board, 
one red and one green, that can be used instead of the RGB LEDs.

On the front side of the board there are two user accessible buttons as
well as a reset switch.
