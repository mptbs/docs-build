Safe mode and factory reset
===========================

If something goes wrong with the Thunderboard Sense when you are using it, you 
can try to enter safe mode, which skips execution of ``boot.py`` and ``main.py``.

If you have problems with the filesystem, or simply want to erase all the data,
you can perform a factory reset of the filesystem.

Safe mode
---------

To enter safe mode, perform the following steps:

1. While the board is powered on, push down the two buttons on each
   side of the USB port.
2. While keeping the buttons pushed down, press the reset button.
3. The small LEDs on the front of the board will cycle through
   different configurations. 
4. Release both buttons when only the red LED is lit.
5. You are now in safe mode


Factory reset of the filesystem
-------------------------------

If the filesystem on the Thunderboard Sense gets corrupted, or there is
some code in either ``boot.py`` or ``main.py`` which causes problems, you can
reset the filesystem.

The procedure for resetting the filesystem is similar to the procedure for
entering safe mode.

1. While the board is powered on, push down the two buttons on each
   side of the USB port.
2. While keeping the buttons pushed down, press the reset button.
3. The small LEDs on the front of the board will cycle through
   different configurations. 
4. Release both buttons when both the red and the green LED is lit.
5. You are now in safe mode
