Using the built-in radio
------------------------

You can use the built-in radio to send small messages between
different Thunderboards.

The amount of data is limited to 16 bytes at a time.

Using the radio is as simple as::

    import radio

    rdio = Rail()
    rdio.init()

    #Transmit the string 'Hello'
    rdio.tx( bytearray('Hello') )

    #See if anyone answers within 10 seconds
    received = rdio.rx( 10000 )
    if not received == None:
        print(received)
