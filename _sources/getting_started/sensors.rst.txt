Interfacing with the board sensors
==================================

The Thunderboard Sense contains several sensors, which
all can easily be accessed through the :mod:`tbsense` module.

Here is an example that will sample and print data from all the sensors
every 10 seconds::

import tbsense
    
tbsense.Environment.start()
tbsense.Motion.start()

pressure = tbsense.Environment.pressure()
amb_light = tbsense.Environment.ambient_light()
uv_index = tbsense.Environment.uv_index()
rel_humidity = tbsense.Environment.relative_humidity()
sound_lvl = tbsense.Environment.sound_level()
temp = tbsense.Environment.temperature()
accel_measurement = tbsense.Motion.acceleration()
gyro_measurement = tbsense.Motion.rotation_rate()
voc = tbsense.Environment.voc()
  
while True :    
    # Turn on LED to show we are starting measurements
    tbsense.LED.Green.on()
    	
    print( "The current pressure is ", pressure, " mbar." )
    print( "The ambient light is ", amb_light, " lx." )
    print( "The relative humidity is ", rel_humidity, "%." )
    print( "The current temperature is ", temp, " degrees Celcius." )
    print( "The uv_index is ", uv_index,"." )
    print( "The current sound level is ", sound_lvl,".")
    print( "Acceleration vector: ", accel_measurement,"."  )
    print( "Angular velocity: ", gyro_measurement, "." )
    print( "Total volatile organic compounds: ", voc, " ppb." )
    
    #Turn off the led
    tbsense.LED.Green.off()
    	
    #Wait for 10 seconds
    tbsense.delay(10000)
