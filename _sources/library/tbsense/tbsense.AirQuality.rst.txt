Class AirQuality -- Access to the Air Quality sensor
====================================================

The AirQuality functions give access to an indoor air quality sensor. The sensor
is capable of measuring the amount of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the air. A
volatile organic compound is an organic chemical that easily evaporates, such as
formaldehyde or alcohol. Usual sources of VOC is paint, cleaning supplies and
office equipment. Usually the level of VOC is many times greater indoors as
compared to outdoors. Exposure to a high level of VOC can cause symptoms of
illness.

The sensor is able to measure the total volatile organic compound (TVOC) level
between 0 and 1187 parts per billion (ppb). While a lower value is better than a
high value, TVOC values between 50 and 325 ppb are generally considered
acceptable. In general TVOC should not increase above 500 ppb.


Example usage::
       
   import tbsense

   tbsense.AirQuality.start()
   
   # Wait for new data
   while not tbsense.AirQuality.new_data():
      tbsense.delay(50)

   tvoc = tbsense.AirQuality.TVOC()
   print("Total volatile organic compounds: ", tvoc, " ppb")

    from tbsense import AirQuality, RHTemp

    #Retrieve calibration data
    rhtemp = RHTemp()
    rhtemp.init()
    temperature = RHTemp.temperature()
    relative_humidity = RHTemp.relative_humidity()
    rhtemp.deinit()

    #Initialize the indoor air quality sensor
    iaq = AirQuality()
    iaq.init( AirQuality.MODE_INTERVAL_1, temperature, relative_humidity )
    print( "Total volatile organic compounds: ", iaq.tvoc() )
    print( "Equivalent CO2 level: ", iaq.eco2() )

Functions
---------

.. function:: tbsense.AirQuality.start()

   Start the AirQuality sensor. This function has to be called before taking any
   measurements. This function also uses the
   :ref:`Humidity-sensor <tbsense.humidity>` to calibrate itself. The humidity
   sensor is left in the same state as it was before the function was called.

.. function:: tbsense.AirQuality.stop()

   Turn off the AirQuality sensor. Use this function if you no longer need to
   use the sensor and want to save some power. 

.. function:: tbsense.AirQuality.TVOC()

    Return the total volatile organic compounds in parts per billion (ppb).

.. function:: tbsense.AirQuality.calibrate()

    Recalibrate the AirQuality sensor. This function uses the
    :ref:`Humidity-sensor <tbsense.humidity>` to calibrate itself. The humidity
    sensor is left in the same state as it was before the function was called.

.. function:: tbsense.AirQuality.new_data()

    Returns true if there are new measurements since last
    :func:`tbsense.AirQuality.tvoc` or :func:`tbsense.AirQuality.eco2` have been
    called.

.. function:: tbsense.AirQuality.update_rate( [interval] )

    The AirQuality-sensor can update its measurement at a specified rate, either
    every 1st, 10th, or 60th second. 

    Calling this function without any argument will return the current update
    rate. The default value after calling :func:``tbsense.AirQuality.start`` is
    :data:``tbsense.AirQuality.INTERVAL_1``.

    Possible values for ``interval`` are:

        - :data:``tbsense.AirQuality.INTERVAL_1``
        - :data:``tbsense.AirQuality.INTERVAL_10``
        - :data:``tbsense.AirQuality.INTERVAL_60``


Class constants
---------------

.. data:: AirQuality.MODE_IDLE

    Used to stop measurements temporarily

.. data:: AirQuality.MODE_INTERVAL_1

    Used to get a new measurent with 1 second intervals

.. data:: AirQuality.MODE_INTERVAL_10

    Used to get a new measurement with 10 second intervals

.. data:: AirQuality.MODE_INTERVAL_60

    Used to get a new measurement with 60 second intervals
