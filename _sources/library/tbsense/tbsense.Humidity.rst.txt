Humidity -- Access to the Relative Humidity and Temperature sensor
======================================================================

This object gives you access to the Relative Humidity and Pressure sensor on the
Thunderboard Sense. 

Relative Humidity is a measurement of how much water is in the air compared to
how much there can be at the current temperature. It measured in percent, where
a measurement higher than 100% means that mist or dew might form. The sensor can
measure relative humidity between 0% and 80% with an accuracy of ±3%.

The temperature is measured with an internal thermometer, and can measure the
temperature from -10°C to 85°C with an accuracy of ±0.4°C .

Example usage::

    import tbsense

    tbsense.Humidity.start()
    rh = tbsense.Humidity.measure()
    print("The relative humidity is ", rh, "%.")

Functions
---------

.. function:: tbsense.Humidity.start()

    Starts the relative humidity sensor. This function has to be called in order
    to take measurements.

.. function:: tbsense.Humidity.stop()

    Stop the humidity sensor Use this function if you no longer need to use the
    humidity sensor and want to save some power.

.. function:: tbsense.Humidity.measure()

    Return a measurement of the relative humidity in percent.

.. function:: tbsense.Humidity.temperature()

    Return a temperature measurement from the sensor. The temperature is
    returned in degrees Celcius.
