Pressure -- Access to the Pressure sensor
===============================================

This object gives you access to the Pressure sensor on the Thunderboard Sense.

The pressure is measured in millibars (mbar), which is not an SI unit, but a
metric unit often used in metrology.
At sea-level the pressure is defined to be 1013.25 mbar. The sensor can measure
in the range from 300 mbar to 1100 mbar (equivalent to +9000 m above to -500 m
below sea level). The pressure is measured with an accuracy of ±0.12 mbar (±1.1
m).

The sensor can also measure temperature in the range of -40°C to 85°C.

Example::
    
    import tbsense

    tbsense.Pressure.start()
    pressure = tbsense.Pressure.measure()
    temperature = tbsense.Pressure.temperature()
    print("Current Pressure is: ", pressure, " Pa.")
    print("Current Temperature is: ", temperature, " degrees C.")

Functions
---------

.. function:: tbsense.Pressure.start()

    Starts the pressure sensor. This function has to be called in order to take
    measurements.

.. function:: tbsense.Pressure.stop()

    Stops the pressure sensor. Use this function if you no longer need to use
    the pressure sensor and want to save some power.

.. function:: tbsense.Pressure.measure()

    Returns a measurement from the pressure sensor. The result is returned in
    kiloPascals.
    A measurement may take 7 ms when ``mode`` is 0, up to 45 ms when
    ``mode`` is 4.

    ..note::
    Need to convert measurement to pascall from millibar

.. function:: tbsense.Pressure.temperature()

    Returns a temperature measurement from the internal thermometer of the
    pressure sensor. The result is returned in degrees Celcius.
    A measurement may take 7 ms when ``mode`` is 0, up to 45 ms when ``mode`` is
    4.

.. function:: tbsense.Pressure.mode([mode])

    The mode decides the accuracy of the pressure sensor. A mode of 0 is low
    power and low accuracy, while a mode of 4 uses more power and has higher
    accuracy. The mode can be an integer between 0 and 4. 
    If no argument is given, the current mode is returned. The default mode is
    4.
