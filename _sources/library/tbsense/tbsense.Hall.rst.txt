Class Hall -- Access to the Hall-effect sensor
==============================================

The Hall object is used to access and control the Si7210 Hall effect sensor. The sensor is capable of measuring fields up to a strength of 200 millitesla (mT). 
The Hall effect sensor can be set to one of two modes; a threshold mode which can send an interrupt when a certain threshold value has been reached, or a measurement mode which gives a direct measurement of the current magnetic field.

Example usage::

    from tbsense import Hall
    
    hall = Hall()
    hall.init( Hall.MEASURE, scale=Hall.MT200 )
    print( "Current field strength: %3.2fmT) % hall.measure() )
    hall.deinit()

Constructors
------------

.. class:: tbsense.Hall(...)

    Construct a Hall object to access the Hall-effect sensor. The extra arguments given are used for initialization and are identical to :meth:`Hall.init`. If no extra arguments are given, the sensor stays in the same state as the last initialization.

Methods
-------

.. method:: Hall.init(mode, '*', threshold=16, hysteresis=0,polarity=Hall.OMNI, output_invert=false, scale=Hall.20mT, sampling_period=0)

    This function initializes the Hall sensor. The parameter ``mode`` can be one of two values:

        - ``Hall.THRESHOLD`` to use the Hall sensor in threshold mode. The sensor can then be used as a magnetic switch, with optional callback. Interrupts need to be enabled for this mode to work.
        - ``Hall.MEASURE`` to use the Hall sensor in measure mode. The sensor will then sample the magnetic field with a given sampling period. This can for example be used to measure the distance to an object with a known magnetic field.

    If ``mode`` is ``Hall.THRESHOLD``, one Pin-object will be used for interrupts. The following parameters are available:

        - ``threshold`` which sets the magnetic field strength to activate at. This is given in mT.
        - ``hysteresis`` the hysteresis around ``threshold`` at which to activate/deactivate. This is given in mT.
        - ``polarity`` sets the polarity which to activate at. Can be one of the following:
        
            - ``Hall.OMNI`` to activate when the absolute value of the magnetic field exceedes ``threshold``
            - ``Hall.POSITIVE`` to activate when the value of the magnetic field exceedes ``threshold``
            - ``Hall.NEGATIVE`` to activate when the negated value of the magnetic field exceedes ``threshold``. 
        - ``output_invert`` should be set so the interrupt pin will mostly remain high, this is to converve power. If the field strength will mostly exceed ``threshold`` this should be ``false``, otherwise ``true``.

    If ``mode`` is ``Hall.MEASURE``, the following parameters are available:

        - ``scale`` which sets the scale to operate at. It can be one of the following two parameters:

            - ``Hall.MT20`` - the maximum measurable field strength is ±20.47 mT with a resolution of 0.00125 mT.
            - ``Hall.MT200`` - the maximum measurable field strengh is ±204.7 mT with a resolution of 0.0125 mT.

        - ``sampling_period`` - this is the time period in microseconds between samples. It can be a value between 11 and 172000 microseconds (0.172 seconds). If set to 0, samples are updated continously. In order to save power, this value should be as high as possible.


.. method:: Hall.deinit()

    Deinitializes the UV-sensor and frees interrupt pin if ``mode`` was in ``Hall.THRESHOLD``. 

.. method:: Hall.mode()

    Returns the current mode. Use init if you wish to reconfigure the Hall effect sensor.

.. method:: Hall.active()
    
    Returns ``true`` if ``mode`` is ``Hall.THRESHOLD`` and ``threshold`` is exceeded. Returns false otherwise.

.. method:: Hall.callback([func])

    Get the callback function if no argument is given. Set the callback-function if an argument is given. The ``func`` callback function is passed 1 argument. The argument is ``true`` if threshold is exceeded, ``false`` if not. If passed `None`, the interrupts are turned off.

.. method:: Hall.measure()

    Returns the last sampled magnetic field strength from the sensor. If ``mode`` is ``Hall.THRESHOLD`` this function returns ``None``.
