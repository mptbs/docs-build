UV -- Access to the UV/Ambient Light sensor
=================================================

This object gives you access to the UV Index and ambient light sensor on the
Thunderboard Sense.

UV Index
--------

The UV Index is a measurement of sunburn-producing UV radiation. The sensor can
measure a UV Index in the range from 0 to 20. The UV Index can be interpreted as
follows:

======== ==========
UV Index Risk
-------- ----------
0-3      Low
3-6      Moderate
6-8      High
8-11     Very High
11+      Extreme
======== ==========

Ambient Light
-------------

The sensor can also give a measurement of ambient light up to a strength of 128
kilolux (klx). A normal office usually has a light level between 320-500 lx,
while full daylight is between 12-25 klx.

Example usage::

    import tbsense

    tbsense.UV.start()
    uv_index = tbsense.UV.index()
    if ( uv_index >= 6 )
        print("Consider applying sunscreen! Current UV Index of ", uv_index,".")
    else
        print("Have a nice day! Current UV Index of ", uv_index, ".")

Functions
---------

.. function:: tbsense.UV.start()

    Starts the UV sensor. This function has to be called in order to be able to
    take measurements.

.. function:: tbsense.UV.stop()

    Stops the UV sensor. Use this function if you no longer need to use the
    UV sensor and want to save some power.

.. function:: tbsense.UV.index()

    Return a measurement of the UV Index. The returned value is between 0 and
    20.

.. function:: tbsense.UV.ambient_light()

    Return a measurement of the Ambient Light. The result is returned in Lux.
